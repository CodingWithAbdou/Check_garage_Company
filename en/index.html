                              business, such as when we add new products or
                              features, remove old ones, or when changes are
                              needed for legal, regulatory, security, or misuse
                              prevention reasons.

                            <li>
                              - If we make a substantial change to this

                              advance notice to allow you to review the changes,
                              except in cases such as launching a new product or
                              feature or in urgent situations like continuous
                              misuse prevention or legal requirements. If you do
                              not agree to the new terms, you should remove all
                              uploaded content and stop using the service.
